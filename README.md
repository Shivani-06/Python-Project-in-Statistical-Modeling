Hello I am Shivani and I have created the project Brent oil Price Prediction model
This is a python based project developed using time series model ARIMA.
I have divided the data into training and testing set and performed the prediction.
Jupyter notebook has been used to write the code and you need to import statistical modeling libraries which is present in the code.
